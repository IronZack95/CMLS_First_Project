- SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
for multi-class classification we use an SVM capable to perform a binary classification on a Dataset,
also called C-Support Vector Classification or SVC.
Since the division between the characteristics is defined by a hyperplane,
and the shape of this hyperplane is called kernel,
we have obtained the best results with a Gaussian type kernel

- MAJORITY VOTING
Once we have these training models, we analyse the audio tracks.
For each audio track, the six different SVM return a certain class as a result.
Then we apply the majority voting,
so the music piece is classified according to the genre that is returned the most times.
